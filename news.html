        <h3 style=" margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; color: #32CBFF;">Germany's government is planning to allow
            immigrants multiple
            citizenships, overturning a decades-long ban.
            The
            idea, a long standing tradition in many countries, is well overdue say those affected.</h3>

            <hr>
            <p style="text-align: center;padding:20px ;">The new citizenship plans boil down to three changes:</p>
            <ul style="text-align: center;padding:20px ;">
                <li>Immigrants legally living in Germany will be allowed to apply for citizenship after five years,
                    rather than the current eight;</li>
                <li>Children born in Germany of at least one parent who has been living legally in the country for
                    five
                    or more years will automatically get German citizenship;</li>
                <li>Multiple citizenships will be allowed.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Germany's plans to allow dual citizenship have come 10 years too late for Marc Young. "Back then I would
            have
            been the keenest German citizen you could have imagined," he told DW. "But I refused to give up my US
            passport.
            Retaining your old citizenship does not mean you have split loyalties like so many German conservatives
            claim.
            It just reflects who you really are. Changing it is way overdue."<br>
            Young has been living in Germany for 20 years and has long wearied of the political debate that
            re-emerged
            after
            last week's announcements by Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government.<br>
            The reforms the Social-Democrat-led government is planning are part of a wide-ranging overhaul of
            Germany's
            immigration law that is mainly aimed at encouraging more skilled workers to come to Germany and fill the
            massive
            shortages in the labor market.<br>
            The opposition center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which has consistently blocked any such
            reforms in
            the past, immediately attacked Scholz's plans. "German citizenship is something very precious, and one
            should
            treat it very carefully," CDU leader Friedrich Merz told public broadcaster ARD last week.<br>
            Immigrants currently entitled to dual citizenship in Germany include those whose country of origin does
            not
            allow people to renounce citizenship (e.g. Iran, Afghanistan, Morocco), children of parents with German
            and
            other citizenship, refugees who are threatened with persecution in their home country, and Israelis.
            Syrians
            who
            came to Germany as refugees and are considered to have integrated well may also be fast-tracked to
            German
            citizenship.

            The reforms would bring Germany in line with other European countries. In the EU, Sweden had the highest
            naturalization rate in 2020, with 8.6% of all foreigners living there naturalized. In Germany, the rate
            was
            1.1%.<br>
            "The German citizenship law is based on the principle of avoiding multiple citizenships," Greta
            Agustini, a
            German-based lawyer who specializes in immigration, told DW. "Other European countries, such as Italy,
            Sweden, Ireland, France, etc, allow dual citizenship and they have less bureaucratic laws regarding this
            issue."<br>

            Many of Agustini's clients have struggled to find a way to gain German citizenship. "They refuse to give
            up
            their home country citizenship, yet they also want to gain the German one," she said. <br>

            According to Germany's Federal Statistics Office, there are about 2.9 million people with more than one
            citizenship living in Germany, about 3.5% of the population. Though the actual number is likely to be
            higher, as it has recorded an uptick, with 69% of new German nationals holding on to their original
            passport. Here, people with Polish, Russian, or Turkish passports top the list.<br>

                <hr>
                <p style="padding:20px ;">
                    The group that has felt the effect of Germany's citizenship laws more keenly than any other is
                    the
                    Turkish
                    community, many of whom came to Germany the last time the country needed workers: In the 1960s,
                    when
                    a
                    rapidly growing West Germany signed deals with several states to recruit "guest workers," mainly
                    for
                    menial
                    industry-based jobs.<br>

                    By far the most came from Turkey, and there are now an estimated 3 million people of Turkish
                    heritage
                    living
                    in Germany — 1.45 million of whom still have Turkish citizenship. Aslihan Yeşilkaya-Yurtbay,
                    co-leader
                    of
                    the Turkish Community in Germany organization (TGD), said the reforms have come "too late" for
                    many
                    of
                    that
                    original generation — "but [it's] better late than never."<br>

                    "For the guestworker generation, this reform means recognition and respect for their lives and
                    their
                    work in
                    and for this country," Yeşilkaya-Yurtbay told DW. "A lot of Turkish people of the second and
                    third
                    generation will, I think, feel empowered by it because they always had an identity dilemma."<br>

                    "Many people have waited for this, and have maybe given up hope," she said. "And if it really
                    happens,
                    then
                    I think many will become German."

                    Yeşilkaya-Yurtbay says Germany would have been a different country if the reform had been
                    brought in
                    earlier. "People would have identified more with Germany if that possibility had been in place,"
                    she
                    said.
                    "I'm sure people would have been more politically interested and more active in society if this
                    opportunity
                    had been there 20 or 30 years ago."<br>

            The TGD condemned as "racist" and "ill-informed" many of the comments made by the CDU this week.
            "Honestly, I'm shocked that these voices, which are racist, still exist," said Yeşilkaya-Yurtbay. "These
            arguments aren't fact-based, and I think they're very dangerous for society. They're not even arguments
            for me, they're just stirring emotions among certain people, whoever they are."<br>

            Marc Young also thinks that his own experience has given him a "small inkling" of what people with
            Turkish roots have had to put up with for decades. But he has raised German children and has no
            intention of leaving, and will probably apply for German citizenship if and when Scholz's reforms are
            passed.<br>

            "I would still apply if Germany allowed dual citizenship but I would see it now far more transactional
            in nature," he said. "I've paid my taxes and one day will be a German pensioner whether CDU leader
            Friedrich Merz likes it or not. Maybe that would change once I became German, but right now the bloom is
            off the Teutonic rose for me."<br>
